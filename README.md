 Lung Disease Diagnosis — Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on diagnosing different types of lung disease using machine learning. It is treated as a "multiclass classification" problem where the goal is to predict the type of lung disease a person has based on clinical data. The dataset used in this project is available here: https://github.com/abdelDebug/lung_disease.git



Project Overview :

The main tasks in this project are:

 1. Data Preprocessing  
We clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables if required, and scale numerical features. This step ensures the data is ready for training machine learning models.

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
We perform EDA to understand the structure of the data. This includes checking distributions, class balance, relationships between features, and visualizing patterns.

 3. Model Selection and Design  
We build and train multiple machine learning models to compare performance:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Gradient Boosting

These models help us understand how different algorithms perform on the multiclass classification problem.

4. Model Evaluation  
We evaluate the models using the following metrics:

- Accuracy 
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score

These metrics help us assess how well each model is performing overall, and how reliable its predictions are.
